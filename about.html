        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h5> Graphic Designer <span>and Junior Web Developer</span></h5>
        <p>I am a Junior Web Developer. My tools of choice are HTML/CSS/JS, and a few JavaScript NodeJS libraries, such as ThreeJS or others like, AnimeJS, and GSAP. All to ensure responive and fluid experiences, unique to every project. I use animations and well matching colour-schemes with nice and clean layouts to make each project interactive and as eye catching as possible, while still being beautifully designed with crisp prototype mock ups done in Adobe XD and Figma.</p>
